### Description
This project focuses on implementing a basic file encryption and decryption application to illustrate concepts of encryption algorithms for educational purposes as part of a university module.

Users can browse and select files for encryption or decryption using a custom-made encryption algorithm inspired by the Caesar and Vigenere cyphers. Processing is done locally, ensuring that sensitive data doesn't leave the user's computer, potentially reducing the risk of data breaches. This also allows the application to function offline.

Encrypted files and their key can be saved and later used for decryption.

#### The application is for educational purposes only and not intended for secure data encryption. The algorithm may be susceptible to cryptanalysis.
